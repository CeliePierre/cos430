 *  
 *  It has integer fields for the year, month and day of the
 *  score.  The representation scheme is<br> 
 *  <br>
 *  year  : some positive value >= 1700<br>
 *  month : 1-12 for January to December<br>
 *  day   : 1-31 for the day of the month<br>
 *  <br>
 *  such that the three together represent a valid date.
 *  We are not testing for input validity, however.
